# Cumulative absolute velocity (CAV) prediction model based on Gradient Boosting algorithm

Gradient Boosting algorithm is implemented to predict the geomean Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV) of two horizontal components. A Turkiye based regional ground motion model is obtained using The New Turkish Strong Motion Database (N-TSMD).

This folder includes the source codes of the paper submitted to SDEE: Kuran, F., Tanircan, G., Pashaei, E. (2023), Performance evaluation of machine learning techniques in predicting cumulative absolute velocity.
