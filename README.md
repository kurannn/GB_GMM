# Cumulative absolute velocity (CAV) prediction model based on Gradient Boosting algorithm

Gradient Boosting algorithm is implemented to predict the geomean Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV) of two horizontal components. A Turkiye based regional ground motion model is obtained using The New Turkish Strong Motion Database (N-TSMD).

This is the source codes of the paper: Kuran, F., Tanircan, G., Pashaei, E. (2023), Cumulative absolute velocity predicition using machine learning algorithms: Performance analysis and comparison.
